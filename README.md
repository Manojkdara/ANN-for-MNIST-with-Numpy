# ANN-for-MNIST-with-Numpy
*Achieved of 98 \% recognition accuracy for handwritten numbers by an ANN that has a. This neural network, which has 784 input nodes and 10 output nodes, was trained using the whole handwritten numbers database from MNIST, which has around 60000 different handwritten digits.}
*Examined the behavior of ANNs with a variety of learning rates, epochs, hidden layers, and approximation functions, a comparative research was conducted..
